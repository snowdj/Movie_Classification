# Deep Learning for Movie Genre Classification

In this project, we implemented several machine learning models to predict the genres of movies using their **overview descriptions and posters** (since we want to predict genres for new movies, we didn't use features like *ratings*, which are not available for new movies). We further compared those models and made a machine learning pipeline for the best model. **The best model is a concatenated model composed of an encoder for posters and an encoder for overview texts**.

Our pipeline can be used to automatically tag the genres of movies on movie-hosting websites like Netflix and movie-database websites like TMDB.
